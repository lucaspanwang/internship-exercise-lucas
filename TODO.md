# TODO

- I would like to modify it into a React app and add Routes and Links instead of using Anchor tags, to make the website respond more efficiently when users browse between different pages (componenets).
- I will add a Details page to allow customers to click on the food they like and see detail descriptions, diffrent photos and other infomation of the specific food.
- I will add a Like Button for each food item to let the customer to collect their favorite food. The names of the liked food will be saved in localStorage so that the customer will still see the liked food even after reopening the website. Also, I will add a checkbox for customers to filter only the liked food.
